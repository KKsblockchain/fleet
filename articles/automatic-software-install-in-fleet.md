![Automatic installation of software on hosts](../website/assets/images/articles/automatic-software-install-in-fleet-731x738@2x.png)

Fleet has the ability to automatically and remotly install software on hosts based on labels applied to them. 
This guide will walk you through the process of configuring fleet for automatic installation of
software on specific hosts using pre uploded installation images and using label based install
policy. You'll learn how to configure and use this feature, as well as understand how the underlying
mechanism works.

Fleet allows its users to upload trusted software installation files to be installed and used on hosts.
When adding a new software, it is possible to configure this specific software to be automatically
installed on:
- All hosts
- All hosts excluding specific label/s
- Only on hosts with specific label/s


## Step-by-Step Instructions

- In Fleet click the upper menu `Software` tab.
- On top left corner drop down menu, select a team (or `No team`)
- On top right corner click `Add software`.
- In the newly openned modal add a new trusted binary.
- In the `Install` dropdown menu select "Automatic".
- Under the `Target` section select `All hosts` or `Custom`.
- If `Custom` was selected, right below it will appear a dropdown that will allow `Include` or `Exclude` of specific label/s. A list of labels will be shown to configure the proper operation


In the example below Install on all hosts EXCEPT those with 'Okta - Engineering' label

*Install on all hosts EXCEPT those with 'Okta - Engineering' label*


```
Current supported installation files, manual upload of these formats:
- Macos: .pkg
- Windows: .msi, .exe
- Linux: .deb

Coming soon:
- Ability to auto install from App store (VPP).
- Install on iOS and iPadOS
```

## Using fleet API/GitOps:
The same result can be achieved by using Fleet API, Fleetctl ot GitOps.

Example:
TODO - add API usage
TODO - Add Fleetctl usage
TODO - link to relevant GitOps 



## How does it work?

* After configuring Fleet to auto-install a specific software the rest will be done automatically.
